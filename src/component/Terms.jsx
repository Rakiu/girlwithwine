              Welcome to Girls With Wine. By accessing or using our website (https://girlswithwine.com), you agree to comply with and be bound by the Terms and Conditions described below. Please read these terms carefully. If you do not accept them in full, you may not use the platform.

            </p>

            <p>
              We act only as a digital advertising platform and do not employ, manage, verify, schedule, or coordinate interactions between users. All listings are user-generated, and all communications or engagements occur directly between users without the platform’s involvement.

            </p>




            <h2>1. Platform Purpose</h2>
            <p>
              This platform provides a space for independent providers to advertise their personal or professional services. We operate strictly as a listing and promotional platform. We do not verify, endorse, manage, or participate in any arrangements users may make with one another. Our role is limited to hosting advertisements and facilitating visibility.

            </p>

            <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>
              To use this platform, you must be at least 18 years old or meet the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction. Users may be required to submit proof of age. Providing false age information may result in immediate account removal.

            </p>

            <p>
              By creating an account or posting content, you confirm that you meet legal requirements and that accessing such a platform is permissible in your location. Users are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with their local laws.

            </p>


            <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>
              Users must behave respectfully and responsibly. All information posted—profiles, images, descriptions, and communications—must be truthful, current, and accurate. Users may not share misleading, harmful, illegal, or offensive content.

            </p>

            <p>
              You are responsible for safeguarding your account credentials and any activity occurring under your account. All applicable laws regarding user rights, privacy, and online content must be followed.

            </p>


            <h2>4. Prohibited Content</h2>

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Involves or suggests minors
                .</li>
              <li>Promotes coercion, exploitation, or non-consensual behavior</li>
              <li>Contains threats, hate speech, harassment, or abusive language</li>
              <li>Encourages the use of illegal goods or services.</li>
              <li>Violates intellectual property rights</li>
              <li>Includes stolen, falsified, or manipulated images or data
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Violation of this policy may result in immediate removal of content and permanent account suspension.

            </p>

            <h2>5. Age Verification Procedure</h2>
            <p>
              Service providers may be required to undergo an age-validation process. Verification may involve automated tools, third-party services, or manual checks when necessary. Documents submitted during this process are handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

            </p>

            <p>
              Impersonation, identity misuse, or falsification of verification data is strictly prohibited and may lead to permanent account closure and legal consequences.

            </p>



            <h2>6. Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
            <p>
              Users must not upload or promote material that is unlawful, offensive, discriminatory, defamatory, obscene, fraudulent, or incites violence. All content must comply with local and national regulations.

            </p>

            <p>
              Users must have the rights or permissions to post any content involving personal data, photos, or information of others.

            </p>

            <p>
              If a user includes publicly visible contact details (such as email), the platform is not responsible for messages they may receive.

            </p>



            <h2>7. Content Ownership and Usage</h2>
            <p>
              Users maintain ownership of all content they post. However, by submitting content to the platform, users grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to display, store, distribute, and modify content for operational, promotional, and optimization purposes.

            </p>

            <p>We may edit, remove, or reject content that violates our policies or appears misleading.
            </p>


            <h2>8. Third-Party Content</h2>
            <p>
              Our website may display advertisements, listings, or links from third-party sources. These external services are independent of us, and we do not monitor or endorse their content. Users access third-party websites at their own risk.

            </p>

            <h2>9. No Guarantee of Services</h2>
            <p>
              All listings are user-generated. We do not verify, guarantee, or take responsibility for the accuracy, reliability, quality, or availability of services advertised on the platform. Any communication or transaction between users is conducted independently.

            </p>
            <p>
              We are not liable for disputes, losses, or misunderstandings between users.


            </p>

            <h2>10. Payment and Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>
              Listings may be posted for free or through paid promotional options. Paid listings are non-refundable except in cases of verified technical failure preventing ad display. We do not facilitate payments between users.

            </p>

            <p>
              We may modify pricing or features at any time.
