          <p>
            Welcome to Girls With wine. You need to agree to follow and be bound by our Terms and
            Conditions when you visit our website (https://in.Girls With wine.com/). Before you use our
            website, please read these terms carefully. We will not let you use our services if you do
            not fully agree to these terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our Girls With wine website is a classified ads platform for adult services. There are two kinds of
            people who post or list on our website. The first ones are those who offer similar services
            and those who want to book. There are people on the site who offer their skills and put up
            ads. As they call themselves, an offerer is a sex worker or call girl. This is what we call
            people who come to the site to get services. We call both the person making the offer and
            the person receiving it “users.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Users must follow the rules in order to use the site. The site’s Terms and Conditions list has a number
            of rules and laws. People can only look around this page after reading all of the rules and regulations.
            If you wish to continue looking at our website, it means you agree to the terms and conditions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Girls With wine doesn’t hire, list, manage, or plan encounters with the offerers. We also don’t have any
            say in how the encounters are run. The only thing we do is host classified ads for adult services.
            Anyone can post their services and use them to find new clients.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Platform Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            This website is an online place that is meant to be a digital advertisement for escort service
            providers. People and companies can list and promote their escort services in a safe and private
            space on our site. We are only a go-between; we don’t work with, handle, or hire any escorts or other
            adult service workers. Through clear ads, our goal is to make it easier for advertisers and clients to
            deal with each other in a responsible and polite way.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
          <p>
            People who want to use Girls With wine must be at least 18 years old. You are required to show proof that
            you are of legal age. If you don’t, you will not be able to access the site. Your account can be deleted if
            you lie about your age when you post ads. We can use the age checking tool to make sure you are
            who you say you are.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you want to use adult services in your country, you have to be an adult if that’s the law there. You
            are the one who has to deal with the legal steps if it is not, and you still use it. This is important to
            remember: Girls With wine is not responsible for anything you read on the site.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you make your profile and post an ad, you agree to all the terms and conditions automatically.
            If you want to become an offerer and offer your services. Because the platform doesn’t control what the
            offerer posts on the website, the legal age limits have been put in place.
          </p>

          <p>
            In order to use our site, you must be at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your country
            or area. You must be:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Able to legally sign a contract that must be followed.</li>
            <li>Not using the app in a place where adult content isn't allowed or is against the law.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You promise and suggest that you meet these requirements by joining, sharing, or watching material.
            Any account that breaks this rule will be temporarily or permanently closed by us.
          </p>

          <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>
            The rules should be observed by all users and treated in a sincere and courteous manner. By
            registering yourself as a user, you would be obliged to ensure that the contents on your resume and
            advertisements are accurate, current and truthful.
          </p>

          <p>
            You swear there will never be something illegal, hurtful, slanderous, violent, threatening or
            otherwise wrong that you will post. One cannot upload images or text that are not supported by reality or the images taken by other
            accounts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Anything that occurs under your account is your responsibility, and you need to ensure that you
            keep your login details secret. You must observe all the statutes that become pertinent to you, including those concerning user
            rights, data security, and adult material.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Prohibited Content</h2>
          <p>We do not let people post or promote content that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Involves children or in any way suggests behavior by people under the age of 18.</li>
            <li>Supports actions that involve selling, forcing, or doing things without permission.</li>
            <li>Has racial, religious, gender, or sexually-based hate speech, threats, or abuse on it.</li>
            <li>Encourages the use of illegal goods or services.</li>
            <li>Takes stolen pictures or posts false information.</li>
            <li>Breaks the rules of intellectual property rights.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you break this rule, your content will be removed right away, you could be sued, and your account
            will be suspended permanently.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Age Verification Procedure</h2>
          <p>
            The person making the offer has to agree that the website can decide if the ad can be published after
            checking that the person whose profile was made is at least the minimum age requirement. To make
            sure the person is who they say they are, the website can use an automatic method, a service or an
            agency from a third party. It is possible to check the guide service in India by hand if these other ways
            don't work.
          </p>

          <p>
            During this process, the platform may ask the offerer to provide papers that prove who they are and
            that they are of legal age. We will follow our privacy policy rules for this. In order to do this, the
            website or business uses a third-party agency (details of the third-party agency) to handle the data
            and use the papers given to find out who the offerer is.
          </p>

          <p>
            These papers and IDs will only be used to make sure the people are who they say they are and to
            compare the selfies to the ID photos. The Privacy Policy clearly states that the third-party service can
            only use the information you give them to make sure the offerer is who they say they are and that they
            are over the age of 18.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using someone else's identity or information about their age to make a profile or an ad is against the
            Terms and Conditions and could get you in trouble with the law in your state or country. Your account
            could be deleted, and the person who made the offer could be banned from the website forever.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
          <p>
            Users are also careful not to post or advertise anything which is racist, sexist, defamatory, obscene,
            invasive of the privacy of another person, insulting, racial, objectionable in some other way, engaging
            or concerning money laundering or gambling or involves religious hatred or caste, religion-based, or
            color-based discrimination, pornographic, paedophilic, vulgar, blasphemous, or that any law is
            violated in any manner.
          </p>

          <p>
            What is desirable is that the material complies with all the applicable laws and rules. Specifically, the
            users must be informed that they cannot post or advertise any forms of materials that are illegal in
            their locality.
          </p>

          <p>
            When an individual places any content or makes a profile, he or she will prove that he or she is the
            intended individual, or he or she will have consented to the use of the individual whose personal
            information is published or embodied in the content or profile. They are ensuring this because they
            will not utilize this information in a manner that will infringe on the copyright and the other intellectual
            property rights of another person without their authority.
          </p>

          <p>
            The person making the offer should know that if they include an email address in an ad on the Site,
            the Site has no control over what other users or other people send to that email address.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Content Ownership and Usage</h2>
